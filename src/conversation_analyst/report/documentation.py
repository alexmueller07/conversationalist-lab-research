"""The documentation page: every decision, its reasoning, its source.

A measurement tool for research has a duty an ordinary app does not: every
number it emits will end up defended in front of a reviewer, so every
decision behind the number has to be inspectable -- what was decided, why,
and on whose published evidence. This page is that record, generated from
a structured registry so it cannot drift from the code, and shipped inside
the app so the person defending a number does not need the repository.

The measure catalogue section is built from the live measure registry --
the same objects that compute the numbers -- so a measure cannot exist
without appearing here, and its citations are the ones its spec carries.
